## Project Description
This Flutter app leverages the JSON placeholder API to retrieve and present posts in a user-friendly manner. It incorporates a wide array of features to enhance the user experience, including authentication, token expiration actions, shared preferences for user data storage, and much more. The app follows the MVC architecture pattern and emphasizes the separation of concerns by fetching data in a dedicated services class. Additionally, it incorporates reusable components and various helper functions that enhance the overall functionality and maintainability of the application.

## Features:
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication to access the app's features.
- **Token Expiration Actions**: Implement actions and prompts for token expiration to enhance user security.
- **Shared Preferences**: Utilize shared preferences to save and manage user data.
- **Quicktype Integration**: Employ Quicktype to automatically generate model classes for efficient data handling.
- **Global Error Handling**: Implement global error handling to provide a seamless user experience and this helps the app grows easily.
- **Get Eco System**: Utilize state management and navigation solutions from the Flutter Gey ecosystem for improved app performance.
- **Reusable Components**: Develop and employ reusable UI components to streamline the development process and enhance consistency.
- **MVC Architecture Pattern**: Adhere to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern for improved code organization and maintainability.
- **Data Fetching Separation**: Separate data fetching logic into dedicated services classes, promoting the separation of concerns and code modularity.
- **Form Validations**: Implement form validations to ensure data integrity and user input accuracy.
- **Helper Functions**: Create a library of helper functions in the `utils` folder that can be utilized throughout the entire application, enhancing code reusability and readability.

This Flutter app combines these features to provide a robust and user-friendly experience, making it an efficient and maintainable solution for working with the JSON placeholder API.
